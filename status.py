Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I’ve finalized my topic and collected the two
main datasets I’ll be using: median household income
by state from the U.S. Census and heart disease mortality
rates by state from the CDC WONDER platform. I’ve reviewed
supporting sources and have a general plan for how I’ll
clean, join, and analyze the data using R. I have also started
building some of the visualizations.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I haven’t finished the full set of visualizations
or written up the interpretation yet. I’m also still
deciding whether to bring in a third dataset to expand the analysis.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

The main issue was with the CDC data: the platform
didn’t offer a direct CSV download at first, and some
datasets required manual formatting or login access.
I also ran into a few small delays while figuring out
how to best work with the file formats.
