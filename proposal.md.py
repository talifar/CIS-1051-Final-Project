# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

# Mapping Heart Disease Mortality and Income Disparities in the U.S.



## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

# This project will explore how income levels relate to heart disease mortality rates in the U.S. by combining public datasets
# and creating visualizations in R. The project will be presented in Quarto with code, graphs, and written analysis.



## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

# The project will use R to analyze how income may relate to heart disease mortality across U.S. states. I will bring in at least two
# datasets, one for income data and one for heart disease death rates, and clean and combine them for analysis. The software will generate
# a set of graphs and maps that show patterns and comparisons across regions. Correlation or trend analysis may be included depending on
# the data. The full project will be presented using Quarto, including visualizations, embedded code, and short explanations.



## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

# This project is also being used for my BIOL 3323 (Global Change Science: Analytics with R) course. The R course focuses on data analysis
# and public health interpretation, while the CIS 1051 part relates to software structure, data processing, creating visual output, and
# presenting results in a reproducible, well-documented format using Quarto.



## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

# Working alone



## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

# Import and clean at least two datasets, create two meaningful visualizations based on the data,
# and present them in a working Quarto file with basic formatting.



### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

# Combine two or more datasets, create three to four well-structured visualizations that highlight trends or disparities, and include
# written summaries and interpretation in a clean Quarto project.



### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

# Use three datasets, build five clear visualizations that explore patterns and relationships in the data, perform basic analysis, and present
# a fully documented Quarto project with thoughtful insights and organization.



## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

# My next steps are to identify and download the most appropriate datasets for income levels and heart disease mortality in the U.S. I’ll need
# to learn how to use the tidycensus package to pull income data and review how to clean and join datasets effectively in R. I’ll also research
# how to create geographic visualizations like maps, and how to structure a Quarto project that includes code, visuals, and explanations. If I
# add a third dataset, I’ll need to figure out how to integrate it in a way that makes sense for the overall analysis. Since I’m working alone,
# I’ll handle all data, coding, and presentation tasks myself.
